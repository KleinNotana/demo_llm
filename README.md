# demo_llm_gemini

To use the Gemini API, you'll need an API key. If you don't already have one,
create a key in Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey.

When running the app, include your API key using the `--dart-define` flag:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=API_KEY=$GEMINI_API_KEY
```
This will allow you to access the Gemini API from your app.
